Welcome to XDP-ADC's documentation!
===================================

**XDP-ADC: 10x faster WAF/WAAP that works at network layer (L2)**

XDP (eXpress Data Path) is an eBPF-based high-performance data path used to send and receive network packets at high rates by bypassing most of the operating system networking stack.

We can build an application delivery controller (ADC) in front of web applications running in kubernetes (k8s) with XDP. And because XDP has network layer performance, it's way more than a regular WAAP solution in the market.
